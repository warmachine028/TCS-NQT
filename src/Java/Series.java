/*
Considerthe peiow series:
1,2,1,3,2,5,3,7,5,11,8,13,13,17,
This series is a mixture of 2 series fail the odd terms in this series form a 
Fibonacci series and all the even terms are the prime numbers in ascending 
order
Write a program to find the Nth term in this series
The value N in a positive integer that should be read from mm. The Nth term 
that is calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT Otherthan the 
value of Nth term , no other characters / string or message should be written to 
STDOUT.
For example, when N:14, the 14th term in the series is 17 So only the value 17 
should be printed to STDOUT
